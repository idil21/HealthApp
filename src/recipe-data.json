These dont spread excessively so a couple inches apart will work.\nBake for 12 minutes until golden (they may still appear just a tad puffy but those will settle when cooling).\nCool on the pan for about 5 minutes then slide the parchment onto a wire cooling rack until they are completely cooled, then store in a cookie jar or other airtight container.",

Remove the pan and carefully tilt the pan around to coat the wells with oil.  Set the pan down and sprinkle in a good pinch of sucanat or raw cane sugar into each well (about 1/2 tsp for each).  Put a single layer of sliced strawberries on the bottom of each well on top of the sugar and oil.  Make sure to cover the entire bottom, but don't make more than one layer as the cakes won't un-mold properly.  Set the pan aside.</li><li>Whisk together the dry ingredients in a bowl until combined.    In a separate bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer, mix together the solid coconut oil, the sucanat, and contents of the vanilla bean until thick and creamy.  Add the applesauce and mix until it is incorporated and the mixture is relatively smooth.  Slowly start mixing in the dry ingredients a little at a time until they are fully incorporated.  The batter should be thick and creamy.  Divide the batter among the 6 wells, putting it on top of the strawberries.  Smooth out the top of the batter, then place it in the oven.  Bake the cakes for approximately 25 to 30 minutes until the tops are golden and a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean.  Cool the cakes for at least 15 minutes before un-molding them.  I found it easy to do this over my cutting board.  Makes 6 cakes.</li></ol>",

Add powdered sugar, continue beating until the mixture is shiny and smooth.\nAdd the yolks and lemon juice and whisk until fully incorporated.\nMix flour and almonds and gradually add to the butter mixture. Mix until the doug has consistency of a thick paste. Do not overmix (too much mixing makes the cookies hard).\nAdd dried cranberries by kneading by hand.\nDivide the dough into two equal parts, shape each part into a 20-22 cm long roll.\nRoll each of the rolls in chopped almonds and/ or pistachios sprinkled over two aluminum sheets long enough to wrap the roll of dough. With fingers lightly press the roll towards the center to remove any air bubbles or cracks from the dough.\nWrap each roll in foil, twist the ends and place in the refrigerator for several hours, preferably overnight.\nRemove foil from a roll of dough (keep the other cool until use) and place on a cutting board. With a large, sharp knife cut the roll  into 5-6 mm wide slices.\nPlace the slices well apart, on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Bake the cookies in the oven preheated to 180C for about 12 min (be careful not to burn them). Let them cool on the sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack or a plate to cool fully. Repeat with the second roll of dough.\nStore the cookies in an airtight container.",

You do not need to cook them all the way through. Drain and toss with a tablespoon of butter or olive oil.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove bay leaves from sauce. Toss a liberal amount of sauce with ravioli. Reserve any excess sauce for serving.\nPour into a greased 9x13 casserole pan. Sprinkle top with mozzarella. Bake about 25 minutes or until bubbly.\nBest served with fresh shredded Parmesan, garlic bread, extra sauce and a green salad.",

Be sure to have at least half an inch of parchment paper above the loaf pan.\nIn a large bowl, mix the mashed bananas, oil, coconut sugar, eggs, yogurt, and vanilla together.\nIn another bowl, mix together the ground rolled oats (or oat flour), brown rice flour, psyllium husk, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.\nMix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients. I like to add the flour mixture in three batches.\nIn a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips. Set the microwave for about a minute and then check the chocolate. Be careful with hot bowls! If the chocolate has barely melted, continue microwaving at 15-second increments until the chips are partially melted and very soft. The chocolate doesn't need to be saucy--just melted enough so that you can stir the chips together into a creamy consistency.\nPour the banana batter into the loaf pan. Add dollops of the chocolate sauce on top of the batter.\nUsing a butter knife, swirl the chocolate around so that you create a nice psychedelic swirl pattern.\nBake the bread for about 50-55 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when you pierce through the banana bread portions. Try not to test the bread by sticking the toothpick in the chocolate portions, as the toothpick will always come out with gooey melted chocolate.\nLet the bread cool for at least 45 to 50 minutes before taking it out of the pan for slicing.\nStore any leftovers in sealable container. Refrigerate any bread that you haven't finished in several days.",

    "instructions": "Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.\nPeel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.\nRemove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\nNow it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.\nTightly roll the leaf into a bundle.\nRun your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.\nDon't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.\nIn a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.\nThen add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.\nWith a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\nNow it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\nCook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!",

Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter in a small bowl until well mixed. Transfer to a 9-inch springform pan and press firmly into an even layer in the bottom. Set aside.</li><li>Prepare the topping: Place the sliced almonds between two sheets of waxed paper and crush into small bits with a meat pounder or rolling pin. In a small bowl, toss the crushed almonds with the melted butter and sugar. Spread on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and place in the oven to toast lightly while you prepare the filling, about 7 or 8 minutes. Set aside.</li><li>Prepare the filling: In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and eggs until smooth. Add the sour cream, melted butter, vanilla extract, almond extract and Amaretto and blend until thoroughly mixed and smooth. Pour into the springform pan, place on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes. The cake should appear set but still wiggle in the center if gently shaken from side to side.</li><li>When the cheesecake is done, shut off the oven, open the door completely, and leave the cake in the oven for about 30 minutes. Gradual temperature changes help prevent the top from cracking. Remove from the oven, sprinkle the topping evenly over the cake and place on a cooling rack for another 30 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours.</li><li>Non-alcoholic version: To eliminate the alcohol from this recipe, increase the almond extract to 1-1/2 teaspoons, increase the sour cream to 1-1/2 cups and add an extra tablespoon of melted butter to the filling.</li><li>Flavor variations: For a lemony variation, substitute lemon extract for the almond and use Limoncello instead of Amaretto. The quantities remain the same. Reserve a tablespoon of the graham cracker mixture for topping. You can also make an orange version ~ substitute orange extract for the almond and Grand Marnier (or Triple Sec) for the Amaretto. Top with some shaved dark chocolate.</li></ol>",

You can use more nuts !\nIn another bowl mix the mango puree, flax-seed mix, vanilla essence, and milk well.\nNow make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and tip in the wet mixture.Fold in gently so that everything just comes together.Dont over mix!\nGrease a 9 X 5 loaf tin with oil, and pour the batter into it.Level it with the help of a spatula.\nBake for 40-50 minutes or till a skewer comes out clean. Mine took 43 minutes.\nRemove from oven & let it cool in the loaf pan for 5 to 10 minutes.\nUnmold and transfer to a cooling rack to cool for at least an hour or more before slicing.\nSlice the bread after completely cooled.No prizes for guessing that I was impatient and hence not- so- neat slices in the pics!\nNotes:\nMake sure the consistency of your batter is loose as shown in the picture and too tough else the bread will be dry and texture will be dense.Use mango puree or milk to loosen it.\nThe oven settings are different for everybody. Keep a watch on the bread while in oven .",

Coat the parchment paper and a large kitchen bowl with cooking spray. Bowl should be large enough to hold all of the popcorn  this is where you will coat the popcorn. Set the bowl and the baking sheet aside. Have the popcorn in a separate bowl for now.</li><li>Bring sugar and  cup water to a boil over medium high heat in a sauce pan. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Once the mixture is boiling  lift the pan and give it a swirl every 30 secs or so. Do not mix with a spoon and do not try to scrape what forms on the sides of the pan into the mix. Just swirl. In 10-12 minutes the mixture will turn a deep amber caramel color. Remove the pan from the heat now.</li><li>Stir in the butter and hot sauce. This will cause a lot of sizzling noise and the mix will bubble furiously. Return to the stove top and return to a boil for another 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and working quickly add the salt, baking soda and cayenne and stir those in. When you add the baking soda a strange reaction will happen and the mix will change to an orange color  dont worry  it is supposed to do that  just keep working.</li><li>Into the prepared bowl, add some popcorn and a little sauce, then more popcorn and more sauce. Make about 4 layers. Then with a spatula or wooden spoon gently mix the popcorn so that it all become coated with the sauce. Pour the popcorn into your prepared baking dish and continues to stir to coat the popcorn. (Immediately put your sauce pan and your bowl in the sink and run warm water into them).</li><li>Spread the popcorn out onto the baking sheet and place into the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, remove the tray and mix the popcorn. Place back in the oven and bake for another 5-10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.</li></ol>",

Stir in the egg, milk, cheese and lemon mixture.
